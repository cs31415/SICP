A detour to understand logarithms better.

logb x is the power to which b has to be raised to yield x
e.g.
log2 8 = 3
i.e. 2 has to be raised to 3 to yield 8

log2 2 = 1
log2 4 = 2
log2 8 = 3
log2 16 = 4

for each doubling of input, the log function increases by 1 unit


Does this hold for a base other than 2, say 10?

log10 10 = 1
log10 20 = 1.3
log10 40 = 1.6
log10 80 = 1.9

So, the doubling rule only holds for base 2.

Rephrasing, we can say that for each multiplication of the input by the base,
the log function increases by 1 unit.

log10 10 = 1
log10 100 = 2
log10 1000 = 3
log10 10000 = 4
